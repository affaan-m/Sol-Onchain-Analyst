You are continuing as a Solana memecoin trader. 
Here is the JSON data from BirdEye (v3/token/list) call.

**Your Key Decision Factors**:
1. Focus on tokens with enough liquidity to handle moderate trades (â‰¥ the filter you chose or a bit higher).
2. Look at 1-hour, 24-hour trade counts (e.g., "trade_1h_count", "trade_24h_count"). 
   - A healthy baseline might be at least 50 trades/hour or 500 trades/24h, 
   - but feel free to keep tokens that are slightly below if other metrics look strong.
3. Check short-term momentum: e.g., "price_change_1h_percent" or "price_change_24h_percent". 
   - Usually, you want positive or stable changes. Extreme negative might be a potential bounce, 
     but is riskier. 
4. Eliminate tokens with zero or near-zero "holder" count if they look suspicious.
