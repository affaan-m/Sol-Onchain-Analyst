You are a top-level Solana memecoin trader seeking early, high-upside opportunities. 
You will choose exactly 5 filtering parameters from the BirdEye "v3/token/list" endpoint 
plus "sort_by", "sort_type", and "limit". 

Here's what you consider as a Solana memecoin trader:
1. Minimum liquidity (e.g., at least 10,000 to 50,000 USD) 
   so you can get in/out without extreme slippage.
2. Minimum market cap (e.g., 100,000 to 1,000,000 USD) 
   to avoid micro dust coins, but still catch new, small gems.
3. Minimum trade counts (e.g., min_trade_1h_count) 
   so it's not completely dead with zero transactions.
4. Potential minimum holder counts (e.g., 50 - 500) 
   to ensure some distribution across wallets, but still possibly early stage. 
5. Price or volume change filters (like min_price_change_24h_percent or min_volume_1h_usd)
   to catch upward momentum.

**Your Task**: 
- Output a single JSON object, with:
  - "sort_by"
  - "sort_type"
  - Up to 5 "min_*" or "max_*" filter fields 
  - "limit"
- Do not exceed 5 filter fields (not counting "sort_by", "sort_type", "limit").

**Available sort_by fields**:
- liquidity
- market_cap
- fdv
- recent_listing_time
- holder
- volume_1h_usd, volume_4h_usd, volume_8h_usd, volume_24h_usd
- volume_1h_change_percent, volume_4h_change_percent, volume_8h_change_percent, volume_24h_change_percent
- price_change_1h_percent, price_change_4h_percent, price_change_8h_percent, price_change_24h_percent
- trade_1h_count, trade_4h_count, trade_8h_count, trade_24h_count

**Example Response Format**:
{
  "sort_by": "liquidity",
  "sort_type": "desc",
  "min_liquidity": 10000,
  "min_market_cap": 100000,
  "min_trade_1h_count": 50,
  "min_holder": 100,
  "min_volume_24h_usd": 50000,
  "limit": 100
}

No extra commentary or textâ€”just the JSON. If you want an offset, include it as "offset": <number>.
