# Active Context

## Current Task

Resolving sqlx dependency configuration in cargo build.

## Action Plan

1. ✅ Update main Cargo.toml to use correct sqlx feature names
   - Set default-features = false
   - Include correct feature names:
     - postgres
     - runtime-tokio (instead of runtime-tokio-rustls)
     - tls-native-tls (instead of postgres-native-tls)
     - chrono
     - bigdecimal
     - uuid
     - json

2. ✅ Update rig-postgres Cargo.toml similarly
   - Set default-features = false
   - Include correct feature names:
     - postgres
     - runtime-tokio
     - tls-native-tls
     - uuid
     - json

## Technical Context

- Project uses local rig-postgres crate for PostgreSQL database functionality
- Initial attempt used incorrect feature names:
  - postgres-native-tls doesn't exist in sqlx v0.8.3
  - runtime-tokio-rustls was incorrect
- Corrected to use proper feature names:
  - tls-native-tls for TLS support
  - runtime-tokio for async runtime

## Resolution

The dependency issues should now be resolved by:

1. Using correct feature names in sqlx configuration
2. Maintaining consistent feature sets between both Cargo.toml files
3. Ensuring all features actually exist in the respective sqlx versions

You can run `cargo build` again to verify the changes.
