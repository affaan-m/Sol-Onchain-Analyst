# Active Development Context

## Current Focus
- BirdEye V3 API Integration with LLM-based Token Filtering
- Enhanced CLI Interface with Visual Feedback

## Recent Changes
- Completed BirdEye V3 API integration with enhanced token filtering capabilities
- Updated BirdeyeApi trait with V3 endpoints for token list and metadata
- Implemented TokenV3ListResponse and TokenV3Response structs
- Enhanced TokenFilterService with LLM-based filtering pipeline
- Added social and dev metrics support in token analysis
- Implemented MongoDB storage for analysis results
- Added colored CLI interface with progress tracking
- Implemented visual score bars and section headers
- Enhanced token information display with color coding
- Added real-time progress indicators for long operations

## Technical Implementation Details
- Token filtering pipeline now uses o1-mini model for analysis
- Enhanced error handling and logging throughout the system
- Implemented token enrichment with metadata for high-scoring tokens (score >= 0.7)
- MongoDB document structure optimized for analytics storage
- Continuous processing with configurable sleep duration (default: 5 minutes)
- CLI features:
  - Progress spinners using indicatif
  - Color coding using colored crate
  - Visual score bars with customizable thresholds
  - Section headers for organized output
  - Real-time market signal display

## Next Steps
- Monitor token filter performance in production
- Consider implementing additional metrics for token analysis
- Explore potential optimizations for MongoDB queries
- Consider adding more sophisticated LLM prompts for better analysis
- Expand CLI capabilities:
  - Add more command options
  - Implement configuration via CLI
  - Add export functionality
  - Enhance visual presentation

## Active Decisions
- Using o1-mini model for LLM analysis until o3-mini is available
- Token enrichment threshold set at 0.7 score
- MongoDB collection structure designed for efficient querying
- Continuous processing with error handling and retry mechanism
- CLI design choices:
  - Green for positive metrics
  - Red for negative metrics/risks
  - Yellow for neutral/warning metrics
  - Blue for informational content
  - Progress bars for visual score representation

## Known Issues
- None currently identified

## Testing Status
- Token filter example successfully tested
- API responses and data parsing verified
- MongoDB storage functionality confirmed
- LLM analysis pipeline validated
- CLI interface thoroughly tested:
  - Color output verified
  - Progress tracking confirmed
  - Score bars validated
  - Section headers tested
  - Market signal display verified

## Active Context

## Current Focus

- Market data capture and analysis system for Solana tokens
- Two-phase data collection process:
  1. Trending token capture from Birdeye API
  2. Detailed token analytics collection for trending tokens
- API response handling optimization and struct alignment

## Recent Changes

- Updated TokenOverviewResponse struct to match Birdeye API:
  - Added new fields: decimals, fdv, extensions, supply metrics
  - Improved field naming and serialization
  - Enhanced type safety and documentation
- Split market data capture into two separate scripts:
  1. `capture_token_trending.rs`: Fetches trending tokens and stores in MongoDB
  2. `capture_token_analytics.rs`: Processes trending tokens to get detailed analytics
- Fixed MongoDB integration issues:
  - Corrected database connection handling
  - Implemented proper index creation
  - Fixed query syntax for sorting and filtering
- Improved error handling and logging throughout the system
- Cleaned up scripts directory:
  - Removed redundant initialization scripts
  - Consolidated MongoDB setup into single script
  - Removed deprecated test scripts

## Active Decisions

- Using MongoDB for data storage with specific collections:
  - `token_trending`: Stores basic trending token data
  - `token_analytics`: Stores detailed token analytics and metrics
- Implementing rate limiting (500ms delay) between API calls to respect Birdeye's limits
- Using compound indexes for efficient querying by address and timestamp
- Maintaining three core scripts:
  1. `setup_mongodb.rs` for database initialization
  2. `capture_token_trending.rs` for trending token collection
  3. `capture_token_analytics.rs` for detailed analytics

## Next Steps

1. Implement automated scheduling for both capture scripts
2. Add data validation and cleanup processes
3. Develop analytics dashboard for monitoring token performance
4. Integrate with trading system for automated decision making
5. Add more technical indicators and market metrics
6. Clean up deprecated scripts from repository

## Current Considerations

- Need to handle API rate limits carefully
- Consider implementing data archival strategy
- Monitor MongoDB performance and indexing
- Plan for scaling as data volume grows
- Consider implementing data backup strategy
- Maintain clear separation of concerns in scripts

## Technical Context

- Project uses MongoDB Atlas for vector store capabilities
- Vector search implemented using MongoDB Atlas Search and the `rig-mongodb` crate
- Token analytics data stored with embeddings
- Connection pooling configured for optimal performance
- CLI implementation using:
  - colored crate for terminal colors
  - indicatif for progress bars/spinners
  - console for terminal manipulation

## Resolution Progress

Current implementation includes:

1. ✅ MongoDB connection pool configuration
2. ✅ Token analytics data structure
3. ✅ Vector index creation
4. ✅ Search parameters configuration (simplified)
5. ✅ Document insertion functionality
6. ✅ `rig-mongodb` integration for vector search

Current Issues:

- None identified.  Focus is on testing.

Next steps:

1. Thoroughly test vector search functionality.
2. Implement proper error handling (ongoing).
3. Add comprehensive logging (ongoing).
4. Document MongoDB integration details (ongoing).

Technical Notes:

- Using MongoDB Atlas vector search capabilities
- Embedding dimension: 1536 (OpenAI compatible)
- Cosine similarity for vector search
- Connection pooling configured with:
  - Min pool size: 5
  - Max pool size: 10
  - Connect timeout: 20 seconds
- Vector index using IVFFlat algorithm (default for `rig-mongodb`)
- Using `rig-mongodb` for simplified vector search implementation.
