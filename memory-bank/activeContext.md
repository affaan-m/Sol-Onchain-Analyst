# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Market data capture and analysis system for Solana tokens
- Two-phase data collection process:
  1. Trending token capture from Birdeye API
  2. Detailed token analytics collection for trending tokens

## Recent Changes
- Split market data capture into two separate scripts:
  1. `capture_trending_tokens.rs`: Fetches trending tokens and stores in MongoDB
  2. `capture_token_analytics.rs`: Processes trending tokens to get detailed analytics
- Fixed MongoDB integration issues:
  - Corrected database connection handling
  - Implemented proper index creation
  - Fixed query syntax for sorting and filtering
- Improved error handling and logging throughout the system

## Active Decisions
- Using MongoDB for data storage with specific collections:
  - `trending_tokens`: Stores basic trending token data
  - `token_analytics`: Stores detailed token analytics and metrics
- Implementing rate limiting (500ms delay) between API calls to respect Birdeye's limits
- Using compound indexes for efficient querying by address and timestamp

## Next Steps
1. Implement automated scheduling for both scripts
2. Add data validation and cleanup processes
3. Develop analytics dashboard for monitoring token performance
4. Integrate with trading system for automated decision making
5. Add more technical indicators and market metrics

## Current Considerations
- Need to handle API rate limits carefully
- Consider implementing data archival strategy
- Monitor MongoDB performance and indexing
- Plan for scaling as data volume grows
- Consider implementing data backup strategy

## Technical Context

- Project uses MongoDB Atlas for vector store capabilities
- Vector search implemented using MongoDB Atlas Search and the `rig-mongodb` crate.
- Token analytics data stored with embeddings
- Connection pooling configured for optimal performance

## Resolution Progress

Current implementation includes:

1. ✅ MongoDB connection pool configuration
2. ✅ Token analytics data structure
3. ✅ Vector index creation
4. ✅ Search parameters configuration (simplified)
5. ✅ Document insertion functionality
6. ✅ `rig-mongodb` integration for vector search

Current Issues:

- None identified.  Focus is on testing.

Next steps:

1. Thoroughly test vector search functionality.
2. Implement proper error handling (ongoing).
3. Add comprehensive logging (ongoing).
4. Document MongoDB integration details (ongoing).

Technical Notes:

- Using MongoDB Atlas vector search capabilities
- Embedding dimension: 1536 (OpenAI compatible)
- Cosine similarity for vector search
- Connection pooling configured with:
  - Min pool size: 5
  - Max pool size: 10
  - Connect timeout: 20 seconds
- Vector index using IVFFlat algorithm (default for `rig-mongodb`)
- Using `rig-mongodb` for simplified vector search implementation.
