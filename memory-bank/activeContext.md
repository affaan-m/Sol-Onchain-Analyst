# Active Context

## Current Task

Consolidating dependencies and resolving Cargo.lock issues across the workspace.

## Action Plan

1. ✅ Remove individual Cargo.lock files
   - Removed from cainam-birdeye
   - Removed from cainam-trader

2. ✅ Update root Cargo.toml
   - Added cainam-trader to workspace members
   - Added all common dependencies to workspace.dependencies
   - Added serenity to workspace.dependencies

3. ✅ Update sub-crate Cargo.toml files
   - Updated cainam-birdeye to use workspace inheritance
   - Updated cainam-discord to use workspace inheritance
   - Updated cainam-twitter to use workspace inheritance
   - Updated cainam-trader to use workspace inheritance
   - Updated rig-core to use workspace inheritance
   - Updated rig-postgres to use workspace inheritance
   - Updated rig-neo4j to use workspace inheritance

## Technical Context

- Project uses a workspace-based structure for dependency management
- Multiple crates share common dependencies that should be version-aligned
- Each crate may have specific feature requirements for shared dependencies
- Workspace inheritance helps maintain consistent versions across crates

## Resolution

The dependency consolidation is being implemented by:

1. Using a single workspace-level Cargo.lock file
2. Centralizing dependency versions in workspace.dependencies
3. Using workspace inheritance in all sub-crates
4. Ensuring consistent feature sets across shared dependencies

Current Progress:

1. ✅ Removed individual Cargo.lock files
2. ✅ Consolidated workspace.dependencies section
3. ✅ Aligned Solana ecosystem versions to 2.1.12
4. ✅ Removed duplicate anchor-spl dependency
5. ✅ Updated cryptographic dependencies to latest versions

Next steps:

1. Verify build after dependency resolution
2. Test functionality across all crates
3. Document dependency version decisions in codebase

Technical Notes:

- Encountered version conflicts between helius, solana-sdk, and solana-account-decoder
- Resolution strategy focused on using latest stable versions:
  - Pinned all Solana packages to exact version 2.1.12
  - Added explicit solana-account-decoder dependency
  - Updated helius configuration to use blocking feature and disable defaults
  - Updated ed25519-dalek to version 2.0 (latest)
  - Set curve25519-dalek to 3.2.1 (latest)
- Prioritized security by using latest package versions where possible
